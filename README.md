# Hansoft-Jean-AggregateMilestoneBehavior

## AggregateMilestoneBehavior
This behavior updates all milestones matching given pattern with the latest milestone date found from the feature tagged to each milestone by navigating all linked milestones in the team projects.

The purpose is that all tracked milestones on a program level should automatically be updated with the latest milestone date given by any linked team milestone. (Teams are responsible to manually modify the milestone tagged to their stories if team planning is changed)
Then the program milestone can be linked to a schedule task in a gantt scheduling projects to drive the schedule.
